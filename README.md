# JavaLibrary
Library program written in Java for the school's small library, uses Swing.

To download the jar of the program go to GLHSLibrarySys/out/artifacts/GLHSLibrary_jar/ 
within the repository and download the .jar file (note: you will need a minimum JDK version of 11.0.5,
the latest JDK can be downloaded at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

Also note: If you are on windows the file format for the program is nicer and has a .exe file under JavaLibrary/GLHSLibrary.exe
(This also requires a JDK/JRE that is version 11.0.5 or higher)

To work on the project, copy the GLHSLibrarySys folder, it contains all the classes required for the 
program and will work in IntelliJ Idea.

# NEW
A compact jvm has now been added to the project. Simply download the zip of the entire project and delete everything except for the "jvm-compact-windows" folder. Then from there you should be able to simply run the program by going into the folder and double clicking the GLHSLibrary.exe file. It will open a window with the library program. (For future reference you may have to download the .jar file from the GLHSLibrarySys/out/artifacts/GLHSLibrary_jar/ in the Github repo to get the most recent version of the project. Simply replace the current GLHSLibrary.jar file with the one you just downloaded.)
