# JavaLibrary
Library program written in Java for the school's small library, uses Swing.

To download the jar of the program go to GLHSLibrarySys/out/artifacts/GLHSLibrary_jar/ 
within the repository and download the .jar file (note: you will need a minimum JDK version of 11.0.5,
the latest JDK can be downloaded at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

Also note: If you are on windows the file format for the program is nicer and has a .exe file under JavaLibrary/GLHSLibrary.exe
(This also requires a JDK/JRE that is version 11.0.5 or higher)

To work on the project, copy the GLHSLibrarySys folder, it contains all the classes required for the 
program and will work in IntelliJ Idea.
